   def rate_limit_handler(func):
       @wraps(func)
       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
           try:
               return func(*args, **kwargs)
           except APIRateLimitError:
               time.sleep(60)
               return func(*args, **kwargs)
       return wrapper
   ```

2. **Sentiment Data Quality Issues**:
   ```python
   # Implement data quality checks
   def validate_sentiment_data(sentiment_df):
       # Check for missing values
       # Validate sentiment score ranges
       # Detect anomalous sentiment patterns
       # Filter low-quality sources
   ```

3. **Memory Management with Large Datasets**:
   ```python
   # Use generators for large sentiment datasets
   def sentiment_data_generator(date_range):
       for date in date_range:
           yield load_daily_sentiment(date)
   
   # Implement batch processing
   for batch in batch_sentiment_data(data, batch_size=1000):
       process_sentiment_batch(batch)
   ```

### Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Sentiment Processing Acceleration**:
   ```python
   # Parallel sentiment analysis
   from multiprocessing import Pool
   
   with Pool(processes=4) as pool:
       sentiment_scores = pool.map(analyze_sentiment, text_data)
   
   # Vectorized sentiment processing
   import numpy as np
   vectorized_sentiment = np.vectorize(sentiment_analyzer.analyze_text)
   ```

2. **Cache Optimization**:
   ```python
   # Implement intelligent caching
   from functools import lru_cache
   
   @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
   def cached_sentiment_analysis(text_hash):
       return sentiment_analyzer.analyze_text(text)
   ```

3. **Model Training Optimization**:
   ```python
   # Mixed precision training for faster GPU utilization
   from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import set_global_policy
   set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
   
   # Distributed training for large models
   strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
   with strategy.scope():
